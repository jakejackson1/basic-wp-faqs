# Introduction

This is a very basic FAQ plugin that was created for the [June 2017 WP Port Macquarie Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Port-Macquarie/events/cktnwmywjbmc/) talk titled "An Introduction to WordPress Plugin Development".

Each commit in this repo represents a step to building out the plugin. Most commits will have a dedicated slide in the presentation.

# Slides

The slides for this presentation are available in [Microsoft Powerpoint (pptx)](https://files.gravitypdf.com/f/d2030aad96/) and online on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IOch4oYnBjxXXTT7NHTTGZGRdqeeSmkA8ouVrxXp_do/edit?usp=sharing) (note: the formatting is a little off compared with the original pptx file).
 
# Downloading the Plugin

If you are familiar with Git I recommend cloning the repository so you can review each commit.
